# terraform-bastion-aws

> Deploy a minimal, auto-healing, and immutable SSH Bastion host on AWS.

## Features

- Automatically re-deploy via ASG and health checks
- Automatic updates via CoreOS
- Static IP via Network Load Balancer
- Public keys fetched on the fly from s3 bucket

## Usage

### Variables

- `name` - name of the bastion; suggest 'bastion-<unique_identifier>'
- `instance_type` - instance type of bastion
- `authorized_keys_directory` - folder of keys to allow for ssh
- `authorized_key_names` - names of public keys to allow for ssh
- `allowed_cidrs` - CIDRs that are allowed to reach instance via SSH
- `allowed_users` - Allowed users to ssh. Defaults to shellless 'tunnel' user
- `vpc_id` - ID of VPC to launch instances in
- `private_subnets` - Where the EC2 and ASG things live
- `public_subnets` - Where the ELB lives
- `ssh_port` - Port for SSH to listen on
- `key_name` - specify aws ssh key name to launch instance with
- `iam_instance_profile` - specify an IAM instance profile
- `associate_public_ip_address` - associate public ip address for EC2 instance

### Outputs

- `dns_name` - DNS Name of the load balancer used to reach bastions
- `security_group` - The security group id created and assigned to the bastion host
- `zone_id` - The ELB Zone Id assigned to the load balancer. Used by Route53 for alias records.

### Example

```bash
module "bastion" {
  source = "github.com/backbonecabal/terraform-aws-bastion"
  version = "0.0.1"
  name = "bastion-abc"
  instance_type = "t2.nano"
  authorized_keys_directory = "keys/ssh/"
  authorized_key_names = ["alice", "bob", "mallory"]
  allowed_cidrs = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  vpc_id = "vpc-123456"
  ssh_port = 22
  public_subnets = ["subnet-6789123"]
  private_subnets = ["subnet-123456", "subnet-321321"]
}
